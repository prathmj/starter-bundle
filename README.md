# LinkNYC Starter Bundle

An HTML5 application built for LinkNYC.   
This starter bundle will provide the necessary tools to build and develop content & creative on a Link.    
With this bundle you will have the ability to test locally and package for production.

## Bundle Dependencies

```
$ npm install

```
- `./src/`: The src folder contains a structure for all your project files and assets. All your files should be stored in this folder. When the bundle is deployed, these files are copied to the `./build/` folder and zipped in the `./dist/` folder.
- `./src/scripts/`: All your JS files should be stored in this folder. `src/scripts/main.js` is the entry point. All source files will get compiled into `./build/bundle.js` by webpack.
- `./src/scripts/cortex`: All Cortex player JS files are stored in this folder. These files should never be edited and are the JS core of the starter bundle.
- `./src/styles/`: Contains CSS files and CSS related files such as fonts. You can include the CSS files under this folder by requiring them in JavaScript. See `src/scripts/view.js` for an example.
- `./src/images/`: All image file assets under this directory will get copied to the final HTML5 app directory.
- `./src/build/`: The build folder is where your src files will be copied and prepped for packaging.
- `./src/dist/`: The dist folder is where your production zip will be packaged and stored.
- `index.html` is the default html file for your app. You can put your app skeleton in this file or dynamically create the DOM elements in JavaScript.
- `.eslintrc.json` is used to define any eslint rules and global variable exceptions.
- `webpack.settings.js` is used to store global variables used in the app.

#### Placeholder Image
The placeholder image is displayed on initial view of your creative and when there is an error within your code.   
The image is located in the `./src/images/` folder and can be changed by replacing the file `./src/images/placeholder.jpg`.   
**Note: It is recommended that your placeholder image differs from your creative for debugging.**

#### Silo
Silo manages data on a Link, providing campaigns access to the latest data stored.  When you make a change to campaign data,    
Silo synchronizes in real time resulting in always up to the date data in your creative.   
When developing locally or offline from an internet connection, data will be simulated from within the bundle at `./src/test-data.js`.    
**Note: To simulate data correctly, data should be copied directly from your dataset in Silo.**

### App Settings
All global app settings variables are handled in `./webpack.settings.js`.

* appName is used for logging messages within the app.
* campaign tracks the campaign name in the tracking report.
* datasetID references the production data in Silo to be used in the bundle.
* placeholderID maps the DOM element ID for the placeholder image.

### App Events
* VISIBLE_EVENT
* HIDDEN_EVENT
* READY_EVENT

### App Methods
* Update `src/scripts/view.js` to handle data updates and rendering.
  * Update View.setData() if you need to manipulate the incoming data or preload images.
  * Update View._render() to present the data on screen.
  * Update View.updateView() if you need to update the screen right before the app gets displayed.
* Build the app in production mode and deploy.

### Local Development
You can test and run your code locally using `$ npm start`, leveraging webpack-dev-server to run your code in memory.     
In local development mode JS and CSS changes will be watched and auto reloaded but any HTML changes will have to be manually reloaded.     
Any silo data will be simulated from `./src/test-data.js`, with all events firing as they would in production.    
You can access your app in a web browser at `http://localhost:8080/`.

### Development Mode
You can build your code in development mode using `$ npm run dev`, this will build the app to the `./build` folder.   
Open `./build/index.html` in your browser to run the app.   
This mode is useful for quickly building the UI and viewing the final folder structure.   
**Note: You will have to rebuild after any code changes and all your data from silo will be local data.**

### Production Mode
You can build your code in production mode using `$ npm run prod`, this will build the app to the `./build` folder.   
To package for the Ad Server you will need to zip the `./build` folder for trafficking to a Link.   
You can automatically package the `./build` folder using `$ make dist`, this will zip your code to the `./dist` folder.   
**Note: The zipped bundle and files in the `./build` folder will only work on a Link.**

### Testing
Creative can be tested locally in local development mode to verify: correct design & visual content, silo data and events firing properly.   
If you have access to an SBC, you can test an end to end experience by registering your sbc and trafficking your creative through the ad server.    
**Note: Even with an SBC its recommended that you test on an actual Link to ensure proper serving, displaying and optimization of your creative in a production environment.**
